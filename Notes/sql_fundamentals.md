# SQL Fundamentals Guide

## 1. Table Operations

**DROP TABLE student**  
This command deletes the entire table student along with all of its data.  
*Note: The table structure and data are both removed. It cannot be recovered unless backed up.*

**DELETE FROM student**  
Deletes all rows from the student table but retains the table structure.  
You can still insert new data into it afterward.

**ALTER TABLE r ADD A D**  
Adds a new attribute A of domain D to the relation r.  
Example:  
`ALTER TABLE student ADD age INT;`  
All existing rows will have NULL in the new column.

**ALTER TABLE r DROP A**  
Removes the attribute A from table r.  
Example:  
`ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN age;`  
*Note: Not supported in some database systems.*

## 2. SELECT Queries and Basic Operations

**SELECT name FROM instructor**  
Retrieves all values in the name column of the instructor table.

**SELECT DISTINCT dept_name FROM instructor**  
Retrieves a list of unique department names from the instructor table.

**SELECT ALL dept_name FROM instructor**  
Retrieves all department names, including duplicates.  
*Note: ALL is default behavior; usually not necessary to specify.*

**SELECT * FROM instructor**  
Returns all columns and all rows from the instructor table.

**SELECT ID, name, dept_name, salary / 12 FROM instructor**  
Returns all listed columns and additionally calculates monthly salary by dividing salary by 12.

## 3. WHERE Clause and Logical Operators

**SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' AND salary > 80000**  
Retrieves names of instructors from the Computer Science department who earn more than $80,000.

SQL supports logical operators: AND, OR, NOT  
It also supports comparison operators: <, <=, >, >=, =, <> (not equal)

You can compare strings, dates, and numbers using these operators.

## 4. FROM Clause and Cartesian Product

**SELECT * FROM instructor, teaches**  
Produces a Cartesian product (i.e., every combination) of rows from instructor and teaches.

Typically used in conjunction with a WHERE clause to join related rows meaningfully.

## 5. JOINs and Natural JOINs

**SELECT name, course_id FROM instructor, teaches WHERE instructor.ID = teaches.ID**  
Retrieves instructor names and the courses they taught by joining the two tables on ID.

**SELECT * FROM instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches**  
Performs a natural join, automatically joining on columns with the same name.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Caution: Natural joins can cause unintended results if unrelated columns have matching names.*

## 6. Aliases (Correlation Names)

You can rename tables using AS (optional in most systems):  
`SELECT * FROM instructor AS I, department AS D WHERE I.dept_name = D.dept_name;`

Useful when the same table is used more than once (self-joins), or to shorten table names.

Example of self-join using alias:  
`SELECT T.name FROM instructor T, instructor S WHERE T.salary > S.salary AND S.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';`

## 7. String Matching and Operations

**LIKE** operator is used for pattern matching:

- **%** matches any number of characters
- **_** matches a single character

Example:  
`SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE name LIKE '%dar%';` ‚Üí matches any name containing "dar"

Match literal % symbol:  
`LIKE '100\\%%' ESCAPE '\\'`

SQL supports:
- Concatenation: `name || ' Dept'`
- Case conversion: `UPPER(name)`, `LOWER(name)`
- String functions: `LENGTH(name)`, `SUBSTRING(name FROM 1 FOR 3)`

## 8. Ordering Results

**SELECT name FROM instructor ORDER BY name ASC;**  
Lists instructor names in ascending alphabetical order.

**SELECT name FROM instructor ORDER BY dept_name, name;**  
Sorts first by department name, then by instructor name within each department.

Use DESC for descending order:  
`ORDER BY salary DESC`

## 9. BETWEEN Operator and Tuple Comparison

**SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE salary BETWEEN 90000 AND 100000;**  
Returns instructors earning within the range.

**Tuple Comparison:**  
You can compare a pair of values like:  
`WHERE (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, 'Biology')`

## 10. Set Operations

SQL supports three primary set operations between query results:

**UNION:** Combines results and removes duplicates.

**INTERSECT:** Returns only common rows between results.

**EXCEPT (or MINUS):** Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second.

Examples:

Courses offered in Fall 2009 or Spring 2010:
```sql
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2009)
UNION
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010)
```

Courses offered in Fall 2009 but not Spring 2010:
```sql
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2009)
EXCEPT
(SELECT course_id FROM section WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010)
```

**Multiset Variants:**
- UNION ALL: Keeps duplicates.
- INTERSECT ALL and EXCEPT ALL: Not supported in all DBMSs.

## 11. NULL Values and Three-Valued Logic

NULL represents unknown or missing values.

Any operation with NULL returns NULL.  
Example: 5 + NULL ‚Üí NULL

Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to check for null values:
```sql
SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

Comparisons involving NULL result in UNKNOWN, not TRUE or FALSE.

Three-valued logic:
- TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN
- Used in WHERE, AND, OR, NOT evaluations

## 12. Aggregate Functions

SQL provides five aggregate functions:
- AVG()
- MIN()
- MAX()
- SUM()
- COUNT()

Examples:

Average salary in Comp. Sci.:
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';
```

Total unique instructors in Spring 2010:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID) FROM teaches WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010;
```

Number of tuples in a relation:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM course;
```

## 13. GROUP BY and HAVING

GROUP BY groups rows for aggregation.

Only grouped columns can appear in SELECT unless aggregated.

Example:

Average salary per department:
```sql
SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

Count instructors teaching in Spring 2010:
```sql
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(DISTINCT ID) AS instr_count
FROM instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

HAVING clause filters groups after aggregation:
```sql
SELECT dept_name
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING AVG(salary) > 42000;
```

## 14. Nested Subqueries and Set Membership

IN / NOT IN: Check for membership in subquery result.
```sql
SELECT name FROM instructor
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Biology');
```

EXISTS: Checks if subquery returns any row.
```sql
SELECT course_id FROM section S
WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2009 AND
      EXISTS (
        SELECT * FROM section T
        WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2010 AND S.course_id = T.course_id
      );
```

## 15. Correlated Subqueries

A subquery that references a table from the outer query.

Example: Find students who took all courses offered by Biology:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.ID, S.name
FROM student S
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  (SELECT course_id FROM course WHERE dept_name = 'Biology')
  EXCEPT
  (SELECT T.course_id FROM takes T WHERE T.ID = S.ID)
);
```

## 16. Subqueries in FROM Clause

You can use subqueries as virtual tables:
```sql
SELECT dept_name, avg_salary
FROM (
  SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM instructor
  GROUP BY dept_name
) AS dept_avg
WHERE avg_salary > 42000;
```

## 17. WITH Clause (Common Table Expressions - CTE)

Defines a temporary result that can be referenced multiple times.

Example: Departments with max budget:
```sql
WITH max_budget(value) AS (
  SELECT MAX(budget) FROM department
)
SELECT dept_name FROM department, max_budget
WHERE department.budget = max_budget.value;
```

## 18. Scalar Subqueries

Return a single value and can appear anywhere an expression is allowed.

Example:

Departments with instructor count:
```sql
SELECT dept_name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM instructor I WHERE I.dept_name = D.dept_name)
FROM department D;
```

## 19. Data Modification (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)

DELETE:
```sql
DELETE FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'Finance';
DELETE FROM instructor WHERE salary BETWEEN 13000 AND 15000;
```

INSERT:
```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES ('3003', 'Green', 'Finance', NULL);
INSERT INTO instructor
SELECT ID, name, dept_name, 18000
FROM student
WHERE dept_name = 'Music' AND tot_cred > 144;
```

UPDATE:
```sql
UPDATE instructor SET salary = salary * 1.05;
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = salary * 1.05
WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor);
```

CASE-based conditional UPDATE:
```sql
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = CASE
  WHEN salary <= 100000 THEN salary * 1.05
  ELSE salary * 1.03
END;
```
